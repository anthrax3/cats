Unfinished audio captcha solution; includes otherwise semi-useful classes for signal processing. 
Contains a lot of broken code; currently solves captcha's at about a 50% rate. 
This is my first venture into signal processing and a lot of related code is of poor quality. 
There are known memory corruption issues in some places. 
Probably most useful to a 3rd party is going to be the C++ wrapper to LAME.
